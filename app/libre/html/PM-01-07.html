<h3>HALLUCINATION</h3>
<p>
The Shadow across the hedge<br/>
is just Light dressed in black.
<br/><br/>
To stop feeling lonely,<br/>
break a mirror.
<br/><br/>
Bells toll<br/>
when her clitoris is clutched.
<br/><br/>
Simplicity becomes clothed<br/>
with the flower of silence.
<br/><br/>
Use the magic needle<br/>
to embroider the eye on your tears.
<br/><br/>
You hammer your fingers into the music<br/>
and swallows appear.
<br/><br/>
Life has its own back pain:<br/>
Heal yourself with guitars,<br/>
with teenagers' blades<br/>
or with the echo of a saint.
<br/><br/>
In the mirror<br/>
you view your face from the other side.
<br/><br/>
If death is a thread, <br/>
you weave your own hieroglyph.
<br/><br/>
The devil spewing sparks<br/>
is a brilliant idea.
<br/><br/>
The illusion is a cobweb<br/>
which never ends.
<br/><br/>
Sorrows become foam<br/>
in the oceans.
<br/><br/>
To stop crying each sunrise,<br/>
silence turns into a rooster.
<br/><br/>
Gaze at the living: They are dead.<br/>
Gaze at the dead: They are living.
<br/><br/>
You search for darkness;<br/>
hard to touch yet<br/>
easy to feel.
<br/><br/>
You cure the crazy ones<br/>
with <i>eau de</i> silence<br/>
and they all <br/>
want the remedy.
<br/><br/>
You create, paint, and draw&#8230;
<br/><br/>
But in the end, you know well<br/>
that hope is a<br/>
kind whore.
